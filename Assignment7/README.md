Assignment 7

Create a JavaScript file (link it to an HTML file), and write code for Part A, B and C: 

A.
The Temperature Converter - Let's make a converter based on the steps here and display the coverted result. -Use template literals Only to display the result
• Store a celsius temperature into a variable. Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".
• Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable. Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

B.
Use the BMI example from class activity 1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Lucas' BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Lucas'!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Lucas' BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
HINT: Use an if/else statement

C.
There are two teams, Nets and Knicks. They compete against each other 3 times. The team with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well(draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else -if blocks.
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
Test data:
• Data 1: Nets score 96, 108 and 89. Knicks score 88, 91 and 110
• Data Bonus 1: Nets score 97, 112 and 101. Knicks score 109, 95 and 123
• Data Bonus 2: Nets score 97, 112 and 101. Knicks score 109, 95 and 106
