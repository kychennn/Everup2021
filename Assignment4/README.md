Apply CSS Animation to make a web page as below:
Requirements:
1. The two clock hands rotate the same way as a regular clock.
2. Make the clock hands to move from 3:00pm to 4:00pm. Set animation-duration 10 seconds.
(The hour hand should move the degrees (30 degrees) equivalent to moving 1 hour on the clock while the minute hand moves 360 degrees.)
3. Use external CSS only.


Hint:
1. Refer to study materials for Rotating animation. You need to do your own research on how to rotate the clock hand by using a non-center point rotation.
2. The images provided have transparent background; add a bright color background in your assignment.
